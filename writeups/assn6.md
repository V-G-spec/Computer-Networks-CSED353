Assignment 6 Writeup
=============

My name: Vansh Gupta

My POVIS ID: vgspec

My student ID (numeric): 49003814

This assignment took me about 4 hours to do (including the time on studying, designing, and writing the code).

If you used any part of best-submission codes, specify all the best-submission numbers that you used (e.g., 1, 2): [3,4]

- **Caution**: If you have no idea about above best-submission item, please refer the Assignment PDF for detailed description.

Program Structure and Design of the Router:
I do not feel there is much structure to this assignment. I just followed the guidelines presented in the document and worked accordingly. The main issue was to go through c++ codebases and learn how to integrate two classes (routeEntry and main one). After that, I initialised the class for one function and found the longest prefix for the other and then just followed the assignment pdf

Implementation Challenges:
I was just worried that the best codes will not work with my implementation of the code, other than that this assignment was pretty straightforward.

Remaining Bugs:
nil
