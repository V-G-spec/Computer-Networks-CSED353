# Assignment 2 Writeup
=============

## My name: Vansh Gupta

## My POVIS ID: vgspec

## My student ID (numeric): 49003814

### This assignment took me about [n] hours to do (including the time on studying, designing, and writing the code).

If you used any part of best-submission codes, specify all the best-submission numbers that you used (e.g., 1, 2): []

### - **Caution**: If you have no idea about above best-submission item, please refer the Assignment PDF for detailed description.

### Program Structure and Design of the TCPReceiver and wrap/unwrap routines:
For the wrappingInt32, I only had to follow what was already stated in the problem statement and take care of the mod. I used left shift because it is much easier to handle and computationally inexpensive compared to computing power  

For the TCPReceiver

### Implementation Challenges:
I think as we progress in the assignments, it gets harder and harder to keep track of the different functions, variables and their purpose. So this time I found myself opening all the header files and revisiting them dozens of time while writing each function.

### Remaining Bugs:
I do have a (or multiple) bugs remaining. The WrappingInt32 is fine, but TCPReceiver is showing some error. I may not get time to fix it tonight, but I will definitely make changes later this week and not use best submission for the next assignment. I think the corner cases with _synRec and _finRec need to be handled better.  
Normally my approach at any CS assignment is to first write it down using paper and pen, so I will dry run my code a couple of times now and see if I can find any mistake. It is possible that this writeup will not be updated in case I am able to figure it out due to lack of time.
