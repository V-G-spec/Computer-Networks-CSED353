Assignment 0 Writeup
=============

My name: Vansh Gupta

My POVIS ID: vgspec

My student ID (numeric): 49003814

This assignment took me about 7 hours to do (including the time on studying, designing, and writing the code).

My secret code from section 2.1 was: 908805767b

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: realizing I had to run `make` before testing my code on test cases.

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: Since it is the first lab, maybe mention things like this (Some students might not be from CS bg). And also, can be a bit more clearer with paths as ./libsponge and ./apps are present in both main directory and ./build

- Optional: I was surprised by: How useful reading documentation turned out to be xD

- Optional: I'm not sure about: If things will get easier or harder
